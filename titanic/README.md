Building a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Several categorical features were analyzed via visualization as a pre-stage to the feature engineering. 
Based on that some features were merged into new features. The other features were then preprocessed and transformed. 

Three different models - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier and SVM Classifier - were trained and used to make predictions.
